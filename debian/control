Description: Lwt-friendly logging library (development)
 Lwt_log is a Lwt-friendly logging library. The library is split into
 two ocamlfind packages. The "basic" lwt_log includes Unix log
 destination support, such as files and syslog, and
 Lwt_daemon. lwt_log.core is the pure-OCaml part of lwt_log, suitable
 for targeting JavaScript in the browser, or elsewhere where Unix is
 not available.
